rpi-temperature-logger
======================

This simple node.js application uses a Raspberry Pi, SPI and a thermistor to calculate the temperature read from the thermistor.

Now, why would someone want to do this? I wanted to measure the fermentation temperature of homebrewed beer, and I wanted to do so while away from home.
